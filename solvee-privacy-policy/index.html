<h1>Privacy Policy for Solvee</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 11, 2025</p>

<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Mikolaj Piech (individual developer)<br>
<strong>App Name:</strong> Solvee<br>
<strong>Contact Information:</strong> mikolajpiech44@gmail.com    </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Mikolaj Piech ("I," "me," or "my") collects, uses, shares, and protects your information when you use the mobile application Solvee (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>I am committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information responsibly. As an individual developer based in Poland (EU), this Policy complies with applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>

<p>I collect the following types of information:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Limited to what is necessary for in-app purchases and subscriptions, such as your Apple ID-associated email (via RevenueCat) and transaction details. No direct collection of name, phone, or other identifiers unless provided voluntarily.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Automatically collected data like device type, operating system (via Expo), unique device identifiers, IP address. This is used for app functionality and crash reporting.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information on how you interact with the App, such as features used and session duration, to improve the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Photos/Images:</strong> I collect photos only if you choose to save them to bookmarks within the App. This requires your explicit permission to access your photo library or camera. Photos are stored locally on your device or securely on my servers only if you opt to sync bookmarks. No photos are collected without your consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Data:</strong> Any additional information you provide voluntarily, such as through support requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not collect sensitive personal information beyond what's described, and no data is collected from children under 13 (COPPA compliance).</p>

<h2>2. How I Collect Information</h2>

<p>Information is collected in these ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Directly from you (e.g., granting photo access for bookmarks).</li>
    <li>Automatically via the App (e.g., device info through Expo SDK).</li>
    <li>From third-party services like RevenueCat for purchases.</li>
</ul>

<p>For photos: Collection happens only upon your explicit in-app consent and action to save a bookmark.</p>

<h2>3. How I Use Your Information</h2>

<p>Your information is used to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain App features, including bookmark saving with photos.</li>
    <li>Process in-app purchases and subscriptions via RevenueCat.</li>
    <li>Improve the App based on usage patterns.</li>
    <li>Send essential notifications (e.g., subscription updates).</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Photos are used solely for your bookmark feature and not for any other purpose, analysis, or sharing without consent.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The App integrates with:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For managing subscriptions and purchases. RevenueCat may collect transaction data and app usage for billing. See their <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. As a data processor, they comply with GDPR via agreements.</li>
    <li><strong>Expo:</strong> The framework for building the App; may collect minimal telemetry for development, per their <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>No other third parties (e.g., no analytics or ads). I do not sell your data.</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

<p>Data is shared only as necessary:</p>

<ul>
    <li>With service providers (e.g., RevenueCat) under strict contracts.</li>
    <li>In response to legal requests.</li>
    <li>For business transfers (e.g., if I sell the App).</li>
</ul>

<p>Under GDPR, sharing is based on consent, contract, or legitimate interests, with your rights to object.</p>

<h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

<p>Data is retained only as long as needed:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Usage/device data: Until app uninstall or 2 years.</li>
    <li>Transaction data: 7 years for legal reasons.</li>
    <li>Photos: Until you delete the bookmark or request removal.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can request deletion by contacting me. For GDPR, I'll comply promptly unless legally required to retain.</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights and Controls</h2>

<p>Under GDPR and other laws:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> Correct inaccurate data.</li>
    <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> Request deletion ("right to be forgotten").</li>
    <li><strong>Restriction/Objection:</strong> Limit processing or object to it.</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Receive data in a transferable format.</li>
    <li><strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> For photo collection or marketing.</li>
</ul>

<p>To exercise rights, email mikolajpiech44@gmail.com    . I'll respond within 30 days.</p>

<h2>8. GDPR Specifics</h2>

<p>As an EU-based controller:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Lawful Basis:</strong> Consent for photos; contract for purchases; legitimate interests for usage data.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfers:</strong> No transfers outside EEA without safeguards (e.g., if using US-based RevenueCat, via Standard Contractual Clauses).</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Data is encrypted in transit/storage; app uses secure practices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>Solvee is not directed at children under 13. If I collect data from a child inadvertently, it will be deleted upon notice.</p>

<h2>10. Security</h2>

<p>I implement reasonable security measures, including encryption for photos and data. However, no system is 100% secure; contact me for breach notifications.</p>

<h2>11. Updates to This Policy</h2>

<p>I may update this Policy. Changes will be posted in the App. Significant updates notified via in-app message. Continued use implies acceptance.</p>

<h2>12. Contact Me</h2>
